I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year **EECS (BS–MS)** student at IISER Bhopal working at the intersection of **embodied intelligence**, **large multimodal models**, and **trustworthy robot learning**. My work focuses on zero-shot robot navigation, generalist manipulation, and VLM-guided control, with experience deploying systems on real-world hardware such as quadrupeds, rovers, and all-terrain vehicles.
